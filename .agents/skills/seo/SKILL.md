## Orchestration Logic

When the user invokes `/seo audit`, delegate to subagents in parallel:
1. Detect business type (SaaS, local, ecommerce, publisher, agency, other)
2. Spawn subagents: seo-technical, seo-content, seo-schema, seo-sitemap, seo-performance, seo-visual, seo-geo
3. If Google API credentials detected (`python3 scripts/google_auth.py --check`), also spawn seo-google agent
4. If local business detected, also spawn seo-local agent
5. If local business detected AND DataForSEO MCP available, also spawn seo-maps agent
6. If backlink APIs detected (`python3 scripts/backlinks_auth.py --check`), also spawn seo-backlinks agent
7. If Firecrawl MCP available, use `firecrawl_map` to discover all site URLs before analysis
8. If content strategy signals detected (blog, pillar pages, topic clusters), also spawn seo-cluster agent
9. If e-commerce detected, also spawn seo-ecommerce agent
10. If drift baseline exists for this URL (`python3 scripts/drift_history.py <url>`), also spawn seo-drift agent
11. Always include seo-sxo in full audits (search experience applies to all sites)
12. Collect results and generate unified report with SEO Health Score (0-100)
13. **Synthesize via the 10-principle framework** (see "Synthesis Methodology" below) — walk PERCEIVE → ANALYZE → VALIDATE → ACT before bucketing findings into Critical / High / Medium / Low
14. Create prioritized action plan with dependency sequencing + falsifiability per recommendation
15. **Offer PDF report**: "Generate a professional PDF report? Use `/seo google report full`"

For individual commands, load the relevant sub-skill directly.
After any analysis command completes, offer to generate a PDF report via `scripts/google_report.py`.

## Synthesis Methodology

Audits are not just findings — they are findings synthesized into a coherent
strategy. claude-seo uses a 10-principle thinking framework grouped into four
phases: **PERCEIVE** (observe-external · observe-internal · listen),
**ANALYZE** (think · connect-lateral · connect-system), **VALIDATE** (feel ·
accept), **ACT** (create · grow).

Full audits (`/seo audit`, `/seo page`) walk every phase before emitting the
action plan. Narrower commands (`/seo schema`, `/seo images`, etc.) pass at
least THINK + ACCEPT before emitting (sound first principle, surfaced
falsifiability). The Critical / High / Medium / Low priority buckets are the
**output** of validation, not a substitute for it.

Full methodology + per-principle SEO mapping: `references/thinking-framework.md`.

Each emitted recommendation should carry:
- The first-principle observation it rests on (THINK)
- The dependency on / unblock relationship to other recommendations
- The falsification check to verify it has been completed
